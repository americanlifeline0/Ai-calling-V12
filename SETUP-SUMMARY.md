## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Database Schema ⚠️ **REQUIRED**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- /supabase/additional-schema-for-new-features.sql
```

This adds:
- 6 new tables for the enhanced features
- Missing columns to existing tables
- Performance indexes
- Row Level Security policies
- Database functions and triggers
- Demo data

### Step 2: Fix TypeScript Errors (Optional)
There are some minor TypeScript errors that don't affect functionality:
- Unused imports
- Type mismatches in demo data
- Missing properties in interfaces

These can be fixed later as they don't prevent the app from running.

- **Live Calls**: `/live-calls` (requires `calls` permission)
