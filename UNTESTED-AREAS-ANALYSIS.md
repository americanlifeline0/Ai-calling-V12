- **Live call handling** and routing
- **Call recording** functionality
- **Real-time AI conversation** during calls
- **Call transfer** and escalation
- **DTMF (touch-tone)** handling
- **Call quality** monitoring

**Why Not Tested:**
- Requires actual phone numbers and live calling
- Would incur Twilio charges
- Needs real-time testing environment

**Risk Level: MEDIUM** - Core functionality works, but live calling needs validation

### 2. üåê FRONTEND USER INTERFACE TESTING
**Status: PARTIALLY TESTED**

**Status: NOT TESTED**
- **Production deployment** process
- **Environment migrations** (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod)
- **Backup and recovery** procedures
- **Monitoring and alerting** systems
- **Log aggregation** and analysis
- **Health checks** and uptime monitoring

**Why Not Tested:**
- Requires production infrastructure
- Deployment scripts need validation

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES EXPLANATION

### 1. üîÑ Complete Customer Journey Workflow
**Issue:** "Complete customer journey workflow - needs minor refinement (1 week fix)"

**What This Means:**
- The **end-to-end customer experience** from lead creation to appointment completion has gaps
- **Data flow between systems** needs optimization
- **User interface workflows** need streamlining
- **Business process automation** needs refinement

**Specific Problems Identified:**
```
‚ùå Complete agent creation - Schema validation issues
‚ùå Complete end-to-end workflow - Dependent on agent creation
‚ùå Call log creation - Schema mismatch (call_status vs phone_number_from)
```

**Why 1 Week Fix:**
- **Schema alignment** between frontend expectations and database reality
- **Field mapping** corrections needed
- **Workflow step validation** and error handling
- **User experience** improvements for smoother flow

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Current Issue: AI Agent creation fails due to missing/incorrect fields
const agentCreationIssue = {
  problem: "Schema validation mismatch",
  frontend_expects: ["agent_type", "voice_name", "system_instruction"],
  database_has: ["profile_id", "name", "description", "is_active"],
  solution: "Align frontend forms with database schema"
};

// Current Issue: Call logs schema mismatch
const callLogIssue = {
  problem: "Required field mismatch",
  frontend_sends: "call_status",
  database_requires: "phone_number_from",
  solution: "Update call log creation to use correct required fields"
};
```

**Impact on Business:**
- **Customer onboarding** may have friction points
- **Data consistency** issues could cause confusion
- **User experience** not optimal but functional

### 2. üîí RLS Security
**Issue:** "RLS security - needs enabling (48 hour fix)"

**What This Means:**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** is currently **DISABLED** in Supabase
- **Unauthorized users** can potentially access data they shouldn't
- **Data privacy** and **compliance** requirements not met
- **Multi-tenant security** not properly enforced

**Current Security Status:**
```
‚ùå Row Level Security - Should block unauthorized access
‚úÖ Authentication service - Working
‚úÖ API keys appear secure - Production-ready
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
```sql
-- Current State: Anyone with database access can see all data
SELECT * FROM profiles; -- ‚ùå Returns all user profiles
SELECT * FROM campaign_leads; -- ‚ùå Returns all leads from all users

-- Should Be: Users only see their own data
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid(); -- ‚úÖ Only user's data
```

**Why 48 Hour Fix:**
- **RLS policies** need to be created for each table
- **Testing** required to ensure policies work correctly
- **User roles** and **permissions** need definition
- **Policy validation** across all user scenarios

**Technical Implementation Needed:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ai_agents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE outbound_campaigns ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE campaign_leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE appointments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE call_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for each table
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own profiles" 
ON profiles FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own agents" 
ON ai_agents FOR ALL 
USING (auth.uid() = profile_id);

-- Similar policies needed for all tables
```

**Security Risk Without RLS:**
- **Data breaches** possible if authentication is bypassed
- **Privacy violations** - users could see other users' data
- **Compliance issues** with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
- **Business liability** for data protection failures

**Impact on Business:**
- **Legal compliance** requirements not met
- **Customer trust** at risk
- **Data protection** inadequate for production
- **Audit failures** likely
